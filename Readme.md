 This is a Raffaello cake recipe. Raffaello cake is a dream of coconut lovers and it's also known as Coconut - Almond cake. It's white in colour. Tt is inspired by the Raffaello truffles, which are a great combination of a smooth milk cream filling around almonds, coated with crispy wafer and shredded coconut. 


This delicate and elegant cake is made with an almond sponge cake, a white chocolate, Mascarpone and coconut filling and topped with Raffaello Truffles, chopped almonds, white chocolate curls and shredded coconut. It has a great texture and an amazing flavor, not too sweet, not too dry, due to the amazing white chocolate frosting and coconut milk used to soak each layer of cake. The cake has a delicate almond and coconut flavor and is hard not to fall in love with it from the first bite. Try it out, I am sure it will be a crowd pleasure.
